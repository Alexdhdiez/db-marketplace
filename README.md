# Database for marketplace

Project carried out in the course Database Analysis and Design for my bachelor in Computer Engineering.

The main goal was to create a database to manage and represent the data coming from a marketplace.

In `Memoria.pdf` you will find the relational diagram for the primary and foreign keys together with the UML diagram for the database and some examples of consults to the database.
